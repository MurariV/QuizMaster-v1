# QuizMaster-v1
This is my first-ever project. I have built a web application for taking quizzes, which helps students in their preparation.

This primitive full-stack web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. The back end is powered by Flask, a Python-based web framework, with Jinja2 used for rendering dynamic HTML templates. SQLite serves as the database, while SQLAlchemy is employed as the ORM to enable seamless communication between Python and the database.
